# Battle Of Asgard

This is Asgard Hall! Battle with Jotun king using the right weapon to save Asgard
In this game, Havi battles the Jotun king who has infiltrated Asgard with the help
of Loki who opened a doorway through the bifrost.

# Premise

You do not know which weapon the Jotun king will choose - Thor was blindsided by Jotun and is using his fists to beat all the jotun-infantry and has left his **mjolnir** in the hall
Freyja has killed a Jotun general and his blood stained **cloak** is on the floor of the hall right next to the broken big table and small crystals of myr stones
The **excalibur** has to be pulled from the Allfather chest present right next to you
Both you and the Jotun king have the same weapons available to you and you can only draw them once per round!

# Conditions

 - Mjolnir can break the Excalibur but cannot win against the Cloak

 - Excalibur can slice the Cloak but cannot cut Mjolnir

 - Cloak can wrap the Mjolnir and take it out of your hand but cannot wrap the Excalibur


# Win or Lose?

Whoever is the first to reach 5 points will win and cut down the other!

If you wins then the Jotun will submit and if you lose, the Jotun will take over Asgard and the old gods will need to come down - and they will destroy all life on the realm
