# rockpaperscissors

# This is a repo for Odin's project rock-paper-scissors game
# In this game, the player plays against the computer. 
# The computer randomly chooses any option out of "rock, paper and scissors"
# The player chooses either rock or paper or scissor
# Here are the conditions -
# paper vs rock - paper wins
# rock vs scissors - rock wins
# scissors vs paper - scissors wins
# If player wins then the console prints - "You Win! <> beats <>" or if the # player loses then the console prints - "You Lose! <> beats <>"
